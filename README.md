# A.A.P.P.---Discogs-Music-Exploration-Tool
This github is part of an ongoing process to develop an exploration tool for electronic music, that utilizes Visual Network Analysis to facilitate a non-deterministic exploration process. This prototype (so far) was made as part of a semester project on the Techno-Anthropology Masters.
